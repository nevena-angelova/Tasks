<h2>Excel Generator</h2>

<strong>Microsoft Excel Object Library</strong> is used for generatig an excel file.

Since generatig data and filling the excel app table cell by cell is a very slow process,
first the table information is generated and stored in an array and then the excel app is created and filled with the info from the 'data' array, the excel formulas and styles are applied.
The output file is saved in the root directory.

<h2>Factorials Calculator</h2>

The CalculateFactoriel function that provides the calculation is based on for loop which starts from 2, because 0! and 1! is 1. If the input number (n) is 0 or 1 the result is one, otherwise it is multiplied by the index of the iterations.
